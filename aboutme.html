  <h2>Robotics Reflection</h2>
  <p style = "font-family: Constantia;" "margin-left: 40px">
    Robotics is much more nuanced than I had thought. The ethics and core principles behind robotics could easily be debated heavily and it would still result in an agreement to disagree. Robotics are wildly complex and useful, 
    particularly for minimizing the harmful impact of human bias and/or error, but it does raise the question of the replacement of humans with robots. It can and will be nervewracking to place trust in hardware that could
    malfunction, but that could be countered by the dangers of trusting humans who are infinitely more complicated. <br>
  </p>
  <p style = "font-family: Constantia;" "margin-left: 40px">
    I liked having groups to bounce ideas off of, particularly because I don't know much about robotics and don't have a physics foundation. Next time, though, I will be sure to ask if I don't understand.
